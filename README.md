# Restaurant-Aplication
This was one part (the part that i did) of my last project of the higher Technical Certificare in computer applications development. 

The full app was about the full control of a restaurant that let you make reservations with your Windows phone or web site. It also let you make your food command into the reservation.

My part was the administration control of the restaurant, adding food, images, menus, and changing the state of them (visible or not)
